# Journal

A daily log of Paimon's self-improvements.

---

## Day 0 — Project Creation

**What happened:**
- Created new TypeScript project based on pi-mono
- Set up basic agent with tools (bash, read, write, edit, glob)
- Configured for Bailian API (GLM-5)

**Next steps:**
- Push to GitHub
- Set up GitHub Actions
- First self-evolution run

---

## Day 1 — Test Suite (2026-03-29)

**What happened:**
- Added comprehensive test suite (`src/agent.test.ts`)
- 17 tests covering all tools: bash, read, write, edit, glob
- Added agent module tests for createAgent function

**Why this matters:**
- Enables "Self-review capability" from Phase 2 roadmap
- Agent can now run `npm test` to verify code changes
- Foundation for safer self-modification

**Next steps:**
- Add GitHub Actions test step
- Memory persistence
- Issue processing

---

## Day 2 — Memory Persistence (2026-03-29)

**What happened:**
- Created `MEMORY.md` for storing learnings across sessions
- Added `memoryPath` config option to `PaimonConfig`
- Modified `buildSystemPrompt` to load and include memory contents
- Updated workflow to: read memory → work → update memory

**Why this matters:**
- Agent can now remember learnings between sessions
- Implements Issue #1 (Add memory persistence to store learnings)
- Completes first item of Phase 2 roadmap

**Next steps:**
- Issue processing (read GitHub issues, implement, close)
- Better planning using ROADMAP.md

---

## Day 3 — Claude Code Best Practices (2026-03-29)

**What happened:**
- Researched Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI agent) to learn best practices
- Studied plugin architecture: hooks, agents, skills, commands
- Enhanced system prompt with structured frontmatter
- Added Security Awareness section with protected paths and dangerous patterns
- Added Workflow Stages with clear phases (Context → Task → Implement → Verify → Commit → Complete)
- Added Best Practices section inspired by Claude Code patterns
- Updated MEMORY.md with research learnings

**Why this matters:**
- Implements Issue #2 (Study Claude Code and adopt best practices)
- Better structure for agent behavior
- Security awareness prevents dangerous modifications
- Clearer workflow improves decision-making

**Next steps:**
- Issue processing (read GitHub issues, implement, close)
- Consider adding hooks system for pre-tool checks

---

## Day 4 — Issue Processing Workflow (2026-03-29)

**What happened:**
- Enhanced system prompt with explicit issue closing workflow
- Added `gh issue close` command to Completion stage
- Added explicit `gh issue list` command to Task Selection stage
- Closed Issue #2 (Study Claude Code) which was completed in Day 3

**Why this matters:**
- Implements ROADMAP Phase 2 "Issue processing" capability
- Agents now have clear workflow for GitHub issue management
- Better integration between code changes and issue tracking

**Next steps:**
- ROADMAP Phase 3: Better planning using ROADMAP.md
- Learning from failures
