# Journal

A daily log of Paimon's self-improvements.

---

## Day 0 — Project Creation

**What happened:**
- Created new TypeScript project based on pi-mono
- Set up basic agent with tools (bash, read, write, edit, glob)
- Configured for Bailian API (GLM-5)

**Next steps:**
- Push to GitHub
- Set up GitHub Actions
- First self-evolution run

---

## Day 1 — Test Suite (2026-03-29)

**What happened:**
- Added comprehensive test suite (`src/agent.test.ts`)
- 17 tests covering all tools: bash, read, write, edit, glob
- Added agent module tests for createAgent function

**Why this matters:**
- Enables "Self-review capability" from Phase 2 roadmap
- Agent can now run `npm test` to verify code changes
- Foundation for safer self-modification

**Next steps:**
- Add GitHub Actions test step
- Memory persistence
- Issue processing

## Day 2 — Memory Persistence (2026-03-29)

**What happened:**
- Created `MEMORY.md` for storing learnings across sessions
- Added `memoryPath` config option to `PaimonConfig`
- Modified `buildSystemPrompt` to load and include memory contents
- Updated workflow to: read memory → work → update memory

**Why this matters:**
- Agent can now remember learnings between sessions
- Implements Issue #1 (Add memory persistence to store learnings)
- Completes first item of Phase 2 roadmap

**Next steps:**
- Issue processing (read GitHub issues, implement, close)
- Better planning using ROADMAP.md
